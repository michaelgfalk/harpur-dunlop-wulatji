	abstract = {Charles Harpur was the oustanding radical intellectual of early nineteenth-century New South Wales. His particular brand of spiritualised republicanism has long been of interest to scholars, but hitherto analysts of his politics have focussed mainly on the content of his opinions, rather than the form in which he expressed them. In this essay, I present a formalist analysis of Harpur's poetry, revealing how he structured his verse to express his radical convictions. His finest poems are inevitably perspectival and progressive. He was a pluralist who sought to represent reality from a range of perspectives; and he was an idealist who described objects in terms of their progressive growth toward higher forms. If we recognise these two elements of his poetics, we can come to a truer understanding of his politics and a fairer assessment of his achievement as a poet.},

	abstract = {More than a decade ago Elizabeth Perkins reprinted a forgotten prose piece of Charles Harpur, and helped to pinpoint an interpretative crux which still remains unresolved. The work was "The Importance Of A Rhyme: A Story Of The Old Dock-Yard", published originally in the Weekly Register of 30 August 1845, and now of particular interest as representing Harpur's only "extant work ... of prose fiction" (p.328).1 The accompanying critical commentary places the piece admirably in the context of the Australian short story, and then of the poet's preoccupations. But it is here that difficulties arise. As Professor Perkins rightly notes, it is "a typical Harpurian creation" in so far as it deals with inspiration; yet it is "improbable . . . that he should satirize the poet's loving communion with nature" (pp.331-2). Her judicious conclusion is therefore tellingly qualified, to the effect that "If Harpur has relaxed his solemnity to this extent, he has consciously written that type of Bulletin story which tried to debunk all kinds of intellectual and cultural pretentiousness..." (p.332). The question remains, however, of whose pretensions are at issue or, more simply, who or what is the object of Harpur's parody.2 Perhaps the poet's "usual... elaborate irony" (p.328) is also at work here; though its recognition will depend on a sound grasp of his poetic credo, and of the illumination afforded by related writings.},

	abstract = {Charles Harpur's reputation as a poet rests largely on the pictorial qualities of his works. Editions of his verse highlight his achievement in landscape depiction, and commentary on his poems has revealed their affinities to eighteenth- century, categories of the sublime and the picturesque. Moreover Harpur himself, in "The Dream by the Fountain", appears to lend tacit support to this mimetic orientation, when he links his poetic vocation with the need to celebrate "Scenes that spread recordless round thee suffusing". Thus his verse is either praised for its accurate observation and for its painterly presentation of detail; or censured for its departures from straightforward landscape presentation and for its dependence on poetic precursors. Yet the standard of verisimilitude implied by these judgments seems itself to be curiously anachronistic and fraught with potential misunderstandings. While early painters of Australian landscape may have sought empirical accuracy, colonial poets were not burdened with the task of scientific observation. On the contrary, they found themselves heirs of a verse tradition which had become increasingly reflective, or conscious of the shaping power of the individual mind. By the time Harpur began to publish regularly in 1833, descriptive poetry was concerned of necessity with the interaction of nature and intellect. We should, then, hardly expect to find in his poems objective renderings of natural scenes. Instead, as I hope to demonstrate, Harpur's preoccupations and poetic techniques place him firmly in the tradition of Romantic meditative verse. But first it will be necessary to establish briefly the continuity of his work with major developments in eighteenth-century English poetry, before attempting a more detailed appraisal of his prophetic mission and its consequences for the portrayal of landscape.},

	volume = {43},
	issn = {0038-3732},
	abstract = {Charles Harpur's landscape verse is now widely appreciated, but it is still far from being completely understood. Commentary has noted its emphasis on elemental nature and on human presence, and that the individual scene tends to assume a symbolic dimension. We lack, however, a cogent theory which interrelates these characteristics and indicates their place in the poet's self-avowed mission to be "the Bard of thy Country". The solution, I believe, lies in the concept of sublimity, which informs such representative Harpur works as "The Bush Fire" and "A Storm in the Mountains". These poems, in all their essential features, proclaim their adherence to the canon of the eighteenth-century sublime. Their language, themes and narrative unfolding recall Milton, Wordsworth and the eighteenth-century descriptive verse tradition, while their concentration on the awesome aspects of nature, and on our emotional response to them, would have found favour with such theorists as John Dennis and Edmund Burke. But even more telling is the interest these works evidence in cognitive processes. For by the end of the eighteenth century, the locus of sublimity had shifted from vast natural phenomena to the perceiving mind; and poets had become increasingly preoccupied with that interaction between external objects and intellect which creates our sense of grandeur and meaning. In what follows, I shall concentrate on two neglected aspects of "The Bush Fire" and "A Storm in the Mountains": their concern with the relationship between nature and mind, and between human and supernatural elements. First I wish to demonstrate the highly conscious strategies underlying their presentation of these motifs. Then, in the final section, I shall argue that these familiar features of sublime verse are indices, not of unthinking assimilation, but of an attempt to infuse the Burkean aesthetic of terror with broader issues of moral and national consequence.},

Apart from that brief and now notorious adventure into the realm of entomology, Harpur worked for more than twenty years on the extensive ornithological and zoological embellishments of "The Kangaroo Hunt, or A Morning in the Mountains". Like so much of his work, "The Kangaroo Hunt" is still "begging about the land" for publication. The final manuscript revision is dated 1863, but Harpur explained in the preface that the first draft was written "many years ago".2 A n extract "From the 'Kangaroo Hunt', an unpublished poem" appearing in the Register of 18 November 1843 under the title "Australian Scenery" was identical with the corresponding section of the revised version, so that work on the poem must have been well under way before that date. During the same period, John Gould published Birds of Australia (1841- 48) and the Mammals of Australia (1845-63). This coincidence of dates invites a comparison between the works of the amateur natural historian and the celebrated professional.},

In a letter to Kendall in January 1867 Harpur had written: "it is my intention to 'shut up', for the next five or six years: when I hope to be able to put forth at my own expense a volume of three or four hundred pages". For a while Harpur had hoped that Thomas Sutcliffe Mort would be able to t poems to England for publication. Unfortunately, fell through because Mort did not leave for England. The des're for a wider recognition therefore came to nought.

	abstract = {Notions of place have been central in the cultural self-definition of settler colonies like Australia, since difference in place is the most visible marker distinguishing the colony from the imperial motherland.' In Australian literary discourses, place is very much tied up with landscape, presumably as difference in landscape foregrounds the distinguishing difference of place. Landscape is thus used to emphasise the distinctiveness of Australia, from earliest colonial writings to the present day discourses of nationalism, literature and tourism. As landscape is supposed to define Australia, it is by extension used to define true Australianness. One of the most poignant metaphors of this long-standing belief is A.G. Stephens's "English spectacles", spectacles that do not allow a true perception of the Australian landscape, and thus need to be replaced by "clear Australian eyes", which can perceive, and afterwards represent, the land "as it really is". The assumption of an artistic realism which can provide such transparent and unmediated access to reality has long been debunked in literary criticism. Yet the notion that writers immersed in any culture not "native Australian" are hindered from proper perception of the Australian landscape by their cultural baggage is still relatively pervasive in cultural discourses and popular belief. I will make an oblique critique of such assumptions by studying the processes of coming to terms with landscape and place in two writers who are commonly associated with this "alien", non-Australian cultural baggage, Charles Harpur as a colonial writer, and Peter Skrzynecki as a "migrant" or "multicultural" writer. With this choice I intend to bring together two discourses of Australian literary criticism which have long been kept strictly separate, as if they represented totally different modes of writing and experience.},

In taking to his heart and soul the strange new landscape, 'his muse became the muse of the evergreen forest of Australia'.},

The kangaroo hunt worked as a rite of passage and an expression of settler domination over native species and land. But it also enabled settlers to begin to comprehend the complexity of bush ecology, raising early concerns about species extinction and the need for conservation and the preservation of habitat.},

	abstract = {Mobile hunter-gatherers are often characterized as living in small communities where mobility and group size are products of the environmentally determined distribution of resources, and where social organization is multi-scalar: groups of co-residents are nested within small communities that are, in turn, nested within small-scale societies. Such organization is often assumed to be reflective of the human past, emerging as human cognition and communication evolved through earlier fission-fusion social processes, typical of many primate social systems. We review the history of this assumption in light of recent empirical data of co-residence and social networks among contemporary hunter-gatherers. We suggest that while residential and foraging groups are often small, there is little evidence that these groups are drawn from small communities nested within small-scale societies. Most mobile hunter-gatherers live in groups dominated by links between non-relatives, where residential group membership is fluid and supports large-scale social networks of interaction. We investigate these dynamics with fine-grained observational data on Martu foraging groups and social organization in Australia's Western Desert. The composition of Martu foraging groups is distinct from that of residential groups, although both are dominated by ties between individuals who have no close biological relationships. The number of individuals in a foraging group varies with habitat quality, but in a dynamic way, as group size is shaped by ecological legacies of land use. The flexible size and composition of foraging groups link individuals across their “estates”: spatially explicit storehouses of ritual and relational wealth, inherited across generations through maintaining expansive networks of social interaction in a large and complex society. We propose that human cognition is tied to development of such expansive social relationships and co-evolved with dynamic socio-ecological interactions expressed in large-scale networks of relational wealth.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTIONThe 1870s, 1880s and 1890s were the time of a great flowering of European invented tradition – ecclesiastical, educational, military, republican, monarchical. They were also the time of the European rush into Africa. There were many and complex connections between the two processes. The concept of Empire was central to the process of inventing tradition within Europe itself, but the African empires came so late in the day that they demonstrate the effects rather than the causes of European invented tradition. Deployed in Africa, however, the new traditions took on a peculiar character, distinguishing them from both their European and Asian Imperial forms.By contrast to India many parts of Africa became colonies of white settlement. This meant that the settlers had to define themselves as natural and undisputed masters of vast numbers of Africans. They drew upon European invented traditions both to define and to justify their roles, and also to provide models of subservience into which it was sometimes possible to draw Africans. In Africa, therefore, the whole apparatus of invented school and professional and regimental traditions became much more starkly a matter of command and control than it was within Europe itself. Moreover, in Europe these invented traditions of the new ruling classes were to some extent balanced by the invented traditions of industrial workers or by the invented ‘folk’ cultures of peasants. In Africa, no white agriculturalist saw himself as a peasant. White workers in the mines of southern Africa certainly drew upon the invented rituals of European craft unionism but they did so partly because they were rituals of exclusiveness and could be used to prevent Africans being defined as workers.},

He was there as the new Judge of the Supreme Court of Civil Judicature in New South Wales - the highestlegal authority in the turbulent colony. Energetic and gregarious, Field immediately set about impressing his vision of a future Australia as a liberal and prosperous nation. He courted the colony's leading figures, engaged in scientific research and even founded Australia's first bank. He also wrote poetry- in 1819, he published First Fruits of Australian Poetry, the first book of poems ever printed in the country. In England, Field had been the theatre critic for The Times, and a friend of such major Romantic writers as William Wordsworth, Charles Lamb and Leigh Hunt. In New South Wales, he saw the chance to become a major figure himself, someone who could shape culture and society in enduring ways. Founding Australian poetry was part of that ambition; so too was law. Asked todetermine whether Governor Macquarie had authority to impose taxes in the colony, Field issued a fateful judgement that established, for the first time, what is now called terra nullius. This book is an extraordinary reconstruction of the circumstances and implications of Field's actions in New South Wales using an original and revealing method- the close reading of his poetry},
